# POINTERS POINTING TO POINTER
If a pointer is pointing to a pointer which is pointing to an integer variable , then we use  __**__ instead of 1 time.
And if there's a longer chain, we use more stars. The last one should have stars as much as the total number of pointers.
In that question, ** ppz and * py is actually pointing to same variable by referencing to each others memory location.
